# SideBTextGen
This is a very simple website that I made for [Side B](https://medium.com/side-b) that allows the creation of pretty block quotes/paragraphs/titles/whatever for articles. For an example, [see this](https://medium.com/@MatthewStanciu/https-sideb-textgen-glitch-me-30f4ad3f529f).

# How to properly use in a Medium article
In the future, I might resize the canvas dynamically based on how much text a user enters, but for now, the canvas is a set size, so you will have to do a little bit of work on your own in order to get it to look right.

1. After you save it to your computer, open it in some editor like Paint (Preview works perfectly for Mac)
2. If you want it to look normal, crop the height but do not crop the width.

3. In some cases, you may have something that you really really want to stand out and take up the whole page. In that case, also crop the width. This will center the text, but it will also make the text appear really big.

4. Once you have made your selection in your editor, you can simple copy the image and paste it where you want it in the Medium article.

Have fun!
